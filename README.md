# about this fork,
adding patch.py file. work for patch - voltage scan data


# current dev,
when populate the schema, need to first cp some data from scaninfo, experiment, etc. I will add the small script very soon
<br>
# patch side
need to have some where to save the path str pointing to the h5 file.<br>
need to thresholding the vm to get the spikes.<br>
I have the script ready. just need to agree on where to save the filepath to h5 file.<br>

# vscan side
motion correction is not perfect.<br>
1, set up the method table to try out different settings? <br>
2, strip off the methods from a related, vscan paper? if we want it to be done faster<br>

trace <br>
first to see how's the signal, and if signal good, thresholding should do the job.<br>
